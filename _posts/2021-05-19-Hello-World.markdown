## My plans for this place

I am doing this blog to give back to the cyber security community in my own way.

I plan on chronicling my journey into a career in cybersecurity. Maybe if i show my process it will encourage others to take a similar path.

At first It will be mostly covering courses I am taking. I plan on doing a lot of write-ups for labs and boxes that I do as well.

Eventually I would like to make this a place where I can communicate with the cyber security community as well as have some people reach out to me. I hope to have research and findings that will interest the community as well as further the field.

I may even chronicle some of my other hobbies such as 3d printing.

I also hope to share a lot of the photos I have taken along the way.

I hope you enjoy what you find here!

## Some more info on the blog
So this blog has been super delayed. Getting jekyll and github pages working on an M1 macbook has been a royal bitch, but i got it working eventually. I also face the issue where looking at a blank website makes me want to format it and make it look nice before i write. I get the feeling its more of a procastination technique than OCD. But now I have words on the page and the blog has begun. I am hoping this will be a place where I can detail my journey as well as give back to the community a little bit.
