## Python Crash Course Book

I am currently working through the Python Crash Course book by Eric Matthes. from No Starch Press
I am doing this to go back and build a solid base and nail down the fundamentals when writing python.
I am keeping all of the code in my repository [located here!](https://github.com/mwnickerson/python-crash-course)
